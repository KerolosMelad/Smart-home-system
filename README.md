mySmartHome is a lightweight AI system developed to enable homeowners to control different home parts with hand gesturs.
The system was implemented for my bachelor project. It is implemented based on deep and machine learning algorithms.
It is set up on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model b and could process up to 16 FPS.
